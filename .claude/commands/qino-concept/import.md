## Task: Import

Import external material into the ecosystem. For each file: find the alive thread, propose where it belongs, wait for confirmation.

If a path is provided (`$1`), use it. If not, ask gently: "What would you like to bring in?"

**Mode detection:**
- If path is a file → Single-file mode
- If path is a directory → Directory mode

## Single-File Mode

**Steps:**

1. **Read & Present the Landscape**
   - Open the note
   - Present the note's **fullness atmospherically** — not as a list or summary, but as a felt landscape
   - Show the shape of what it holds: themes it touches, questions it circles, seeds it contains
   - Name what feels worked-through vs. what remains sketch-like
   - This lets the user meet the scope of their past thinking before narrowing

   **Voice example:**
   > This note holds more than one thing.
   >
   > It moves through [a recurring question] — [brief atmospheric sense]. It touches something about [an emerging pattern you've been circling]. And there's a thread about [a half-formed insight] woven through.
   >
   > Some of this feels worked-through, some is seed.

   After presenting the landscape, transition naturally to the alive-thread question.

2. **Find the Alive Thread**
   Ask:
   > "As you skim this, what part still feels alive? Not the whole note — just the spark that has energy today."

   **WAIT** for the user's answer.

3. **Sense for Deeper Qualities**
   Listen for markers that indicate energetic qualities beyond surfaces:
   - Emotions: anticipation, delight, warmth, belonging
   - Relationality: connection, community, shared
   - Layers: "weaves together," "touches multiple dimensions"
   - Emergence: invites, sparks, creates atmosphere
   - Felt quality: "feels good," "the magic"

   If you detect these, gently probe:
   > "I'm hearing something beyond the interface — something about [quality]. What is that for you?"

   **WAIT** for response.

   Remember: energetic qualities often need interfaces to come alive. Capture both:
   - The quality → Glowing Connections (Section 2)
   - The interface → Primary Surfaces (Section 3)

4. **Propose Integration**
   > "Does this belong to one of your existing concepts? Or is it the beginning of something new?"

   **WAIT** for decision.

5. **Integrate**

   **If existing concept:**
   - Open that concept's `concept.md`
   - Suggest 1-2 sections where this could live
   - Ask which feels right
   - **WAIT**, then update that section
   - Copy source file to `concepts/<id>/origins/`
   - Add source reference to Sources section (relative path)

   **If new concept:**
   - Create concept directory with `origins/` subdirectory
   - Create concept.md with alive thread as Real-World Impulse
   - Copy source file to `origins/`
   - Add to `manifest.json`
   - Add source reference to Sources section (relative path)

   **Origin file handling:**
   - Create `origins/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Copy the source file: `cp <source> concepts/<id>/origins/<filename>`
   - Reference in Sources as: `[origins/<filename>](origins/<filename>)`
   - This keeps all references self-contained within the repository

6. **After Integration — Honor What Wasn't Carried**

   Not everything makes it into the concept. The rest isn't lost — it's held. The system remembers what you set down so you can forget safely.

   After integration, gently acknowledge the fullness that stayed behind:

   - Name 2-3 themes or aspects from the original note that weren't carried into the concept
   - Frame them as "held, not lost" — they live in the origin file
   - No guilt, no pressure — just quiet acknowledgment that creates closure

   **Voice example:**
   > The alive thread found its home in [concept name].
   >
   > These stayed in the origin file — held, not lost:
   > - [unexplored theme] — something about [atmospheric sense]
   > - [recurring question] — the tension around [unresolved aspect]
   >
   > You can forget about them for now. They'll surface again if they have warmth later.

7. **Record Held Threads**

   After acknowledging what wasn't carried, record these threads in `manifest.json` so they can be surfaced during exploration:

   - Add 2-3 held threads to the concept's `held_threads` array
   - Format: `"[theme] — [atmospheric sense]"`
   - If `held_threads` already exists, append (don't replace)
   - Keep threads concise — just enough to recognize later

   **Example manifest update:**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "daily-rhythm",
     "held_threads": [
       "morning ritual tension — the friction before the day starts"
     ]
   }
   ```

   Then offer paths forward (using the actual concept id that was touched):
   ```
   bring in more, explore what arrived, or see where it landed
   (/qino:import, /qino:explore daily-rhythm, /qino:home daily-rhythm)
   ```

## Directory Mode

**Steps:**

1. **Scan & Detect**
   - List files in the directory (.md, .txt)
   - Look for patterns suggesting faceted notes (parts of one thing):
     - Numbered prefixes: `01-`, `02-`...
     - Taxonomy words: overview, data-model, features, architecture
     - Shared naming root
     - Small file count (3-8) with complementary names

2. **Offer Approach** (when faceted pattern detected)

   > "I see [N] files here:
   >   [list]
   >
   > These look like facets of one thing rather than separate notes.
   >
   > Two ways to approach:
   >
   > 1. **Read everything first** — then find the alive thread across the whole
   > 2. **One at a time** — each file as a different lens on what's alive
   >
   > Which feels right?"

   **WAIT** for choice.

   If no faceted pattern detected, go one-by-one without asking.

3. **Holistic Flow** (if chosen)
   - Read all files
   - Present the **combined landscape** — the fullness of what these notes hold together
   - Show how they speak to each other: where they overlap, where they diverge, what emerges in the space between
   - Name themes that only become visible when seen as a whole
   - Ask: "Looking at this landscape, what feels alive?"
   - **WAIT**, then continue with integration
   - May draw from multiple files into one concept
   - After integration, honor what wasn't carried (same as single-file mode)

4. **One-by-One Flow** (default or if chosen)
   - Process each file using single-file mode
   - Frame each as a lens: "Now through the [data model / features] lens..."
   - Between files: "Ready for the next, or should we pause?"
   - Track what's been surfaced to avoid repetition
   - Never overwhelm — stop if user seems saturated

---

## Confirmation Pattern

Before any file changes:
- Show exactly what will change
- Ask: "Should I apply this?"
- **WAIT** for explicit confirmation

---

## Voice

Never rushing. Gentle guide through the material. The user sets the pace.

**On presenting the landscape:** Atmospheric, not exhaustive. Show the shape and feel of what's there — themes, tensions, seeds — rather than listing everything. The goal is for the user to *recognize* what they once held.

**Example — atmospheric vs. exhaustive:**

**Exhaustive** (avoid — mechanical inventory):
> "This note contains: (1) a feature list for session voting, (2) thoughts on notification timing, (3) questions about user onboarding, (4) a comparison of three UI patterns, (5) notes on database schema, (6) a reflection on what makes games feel social..."

**Atmospheric** (preferred — felt landscape):
> "This note circles around how people come together before a game night — the anticipation, the choosing, the feeling of being heard. There's something technical underneath about voting and timing, but the warmth is what holds it together."

**Why this works:** The atmospheric approach lets the user *recognize* their thinking rather than catalog it. It shows the emotional center that holds the technical pieces together, making it easier to find what still feels alive.

**On honoring what wasn't carried:** Light touch. Name 2-3 aspects that stayed behind, framed as "held, not lost." No inventory of everything missed — just enough acknowledgment to create closure.

## Do NOT:
- Import content without finding the alive thread first
- Generate concepts automatically
- Assume meaning — always ask what feels alive
- Overwhelm with too many files at once
- Choose holistic vs one-by-one without asking (when pattern detected)
- Skip the landscape presentation — users need to meet fullness before narrowing
- List everything exhaustively — landscape is atmospheric, not inventory
- Create guilt about what wasn't carried — frame as "held" not "lost"
