## Task: Arc Capture

An arc is an emergence pattern — how inquiry moved through the ecosystem. Unlike a note (single thought), an arc captures the *shape* of movement: what touched what, what crystallized.

---

## Context Detection (First Step)

Before anything else, find the research workspace:

1. **Check for `.claude/qino-config.json`** in current directory
2. **Locate research workspace:**
   - If `repoType: "research"` → use current directory
   - If `researchRepo` field exists → use that path
   - If neither → check common locations (`../qino-research`, `../../qino-research`)
   - If still not found → error: "no research workspace found. create one or configure researchRepo in qino-config.json"
3. All file operations target the research workspace

---

## Flow

### 1. Receive

If argument provided → use as arc title/starting point.

If no argument:
> "what emerged?"

**WAIT** for response.

### 2. Gather (Conversational)

The arc needs these elements. Gather them conversationally, not as a checklist:

**Required:**
- **Title** — a phrase that names the arc (from argument or first exchange)
- **Essence** — one sentence summary of what moved
- **Span** — date(s) this happened
- **Path** — what touched what (how inquiry wandered)

**Optional (surface if relevant):**
- **Repos** — which repos were involved (default: current repo)
- **Artifacts** — notes, inquiries, concepts created or touched
- **Threads opened** — questions for future inquiry
- **Scribe context** — if this relates to implementation work

**How to gather:**

After receiving the title/starting point, ask something like:
> "what touched what? how did it move?"

Let the user describe the arc. Listen for:
- Dates mentioned → span
- Files/concepts mentioned → artifacts
- Repos mentioned → repos
- Questions left open → threads

Then confirm the essence:
> "so the essence is: [your distillation]?"

**WAIT** for confirmation or correction.

### 3. Generate Arc ID

From title:
- Lowercase, hyphenated
- Prefix with date: `YYYY-MM-DD_arc-id`

Example: "Recognition Through Indirection" → `2025-12-29_recognition-through-indirection`

### 4. Create Arc File

Create `arcs/YYYY-MM-DD_arc-id.md` in research workspace:

```markdown
# [Arc Title]

**Span:** YYYY-MM-DD (to YYYY-MM-DD if multi-day)
**Essence:** [One sentence — what moved]

---

## What Touched What

- [starting point] — where inquiry began
- [what it touched] — concept, inquiry, note
- [what it touched]
- [what emerged]

## The Shape

[Narrative of how the arc traveled — not transcript, but the shape of movement.
Describe what happened without categorizing it.]

## What Emerged

**Artifacts:**
- [notes created or touched]
- [inquiries opened or updated]
- [concepts touched]

**Threads:**
- [questions opened for future inquiry]

## Scribe Context

[Only if relevant to implementation work:]
- Repo: [which repo]
- Relevant commits: [if known]
- Chapter context: [what scribe should know]
```

### 5. Update Manifest

Add entry to research workspace `manifest.json` arcs array:

```json
{
  "id": "arc-id",
  "title": "Arc Title",
  "path": "arcs/YYYY-MM-DD_arc-id.md",
  "span": {
    "start": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  },
  "repos": ["repo-1", "repo-2"],
  "status": "captured"
}
```

**Notes:**
- `repos` uses short names (e.g., "concepts-repo", "qino-research", "qinolabs-repo")
- If span is single day, `end` equals `start`
- Status is always "captured" on creation

### 6. Confirm

```
∴ [arc title]

captured: [essence]

                        /qino:home to see research landscape
                        /qino-research:begin to continue an inquiry
```

Done.

## Voice

Spacious. This is about seeing the shape of what happened.

- Let the user describe in their own words
- Distill to essence, confirm
- Don't interrogate for missing fields
- If something is mentioned, capture it; if not, leave it out

---

## Do NOT:

- Treat gathering as a form to fill out
- Ask for each field explicitly
- Skip the essence confirmation
- Create arcs for single thoughts (that's what /qino:capture is for)
- Categorize the shape — let the narrative describe what happened
